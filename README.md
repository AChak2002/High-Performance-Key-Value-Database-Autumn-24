As part of a self-chosen course project for the Design Optimization of Computer Systems (CS60203) supervised by Prof Mainack Mondal, I built a high-performance key-value database with an optimized storage engine using LSM Trees, caching, concurrency control for efficient processing of low-latency high-throughput write-heavy workloads. 

This project implements a client-server architecture using the RESP2 protocol, while also integrating the Kernel Bypass technique (using DPDK) and network namespaces to enhance TCP performance, reduce latency, and handle upto 1M concurrent requests over 1000 parallel connections with a median latency of 7.695 milliseconds. Furthermore, I conducted benchmarking and extensive performance testing using the Redis benchmark, analyzing latency, bandwidth, and CPU/memory utilization under 8+ workloads which was documented using Doxygen for clarity. The results can be seen in the benchmark folder, for various request sizes.
